# 1) Bowhead whales
Bowhead whales (*Balaena mysticecus*) are one of the few whale species that reside almost exclusively in Arctic and subarctic waters experiencing seasonal sea ice coverage, primarily between $60^{\circ}$ and $75^{\circ}$ north latitude. Of all large whales, the bowhead is the most adapted to life in icy water (<https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/bowhead-whale>).              

Kovacs et al. (2020, <https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2020.0148>) document range, movement patterns and habitat preferences of the Spitsbergen's bowhead whale population, based on tagging done from an icebreaker-based helicopter. The tracking data are available at <https://data.npolar.no/dataset/395011fc-e32c-4a0c-8350-a50bffbecb1f>.

```{r packages}
what_u_need <- c("tidyverse", "sf", "ggspatial", "lubridate", "spData")
cran_packages <- what_u_need[!(what_u_need %in% installed.packages())]
if(length(cran_packages) != 0) {
  lapply(cran_packages, install.packages, dependencies = TRUE)
}
lapply(what_u_need, library, character.only = TRUE)
```

Warnings: to get the full grade for this examn, use the tidy grammar. Non-tidy solutions will not earn a full grade.

## Load the tracking data
What is the extension of the data file? What does 'tsv' mean? #the extension is ".tsv". It's mean "Tab Separated Values"
Load the data in $\texttt{R}$: call the dataframe "bowhead" for legibility (code should also be human-readable).
Using commands from the tidyverse, check how many individual whales have been tracked.


```{r data}
# bowhead <- read_tsv("argos-bowhead-locations-2017-2018.tsv")
bowhead <- read_tsv("argos-bowhead-locations-2017-2018.tsv")
### how many individuals in these data?
# bowhead %>%
n_indiv = bowhead %>% 
  count(Ind) %>%
  nrow() 

nimPrint("The number of individuals in these data is ", n_indiv)
  
  #OR 
  
length(unique(bowhead$Ind))
#There is 13 different individuals in these data
```

## Convert the Date.Time column to a date time object

Add a column with year and another with month.
Use functionalities from the package $\texttt{lubridate}$.

```{r}
bowhead = bowhead %>%
  mutate(date_time = ymd_hms(Date.Time),
         year= year(ymd_hms(Date.Time)),
         month = month(ymd_hms(Date.Time)),
) %>% print


```

## Data quality
Exclude Argos location classes (Quality) "Z" using functionalities from the tidyverse.

What is the average attrition rate **across individual tracks** (*i.e.* how many data points are being lost on average by excluding the "Z" class on a track)?
Express the answer in % with one decimal.

How many rows are there left in the dataframe?

Use the pipe and the tidy grammar.

```{r attrition}
# write your answer in R here
#refaire en nimble 
bowhead_qz <- bowhead %>%
  filter("Quality" != "Z") 

(countZ <- (nrow(bowhead_qz)/nrow(bowhead)*100))%>%
  round(.,1) %>% print()
```
Turn the data from a data.frame into an _sf_ object with coordinates in WGS84.

```{r project}
# bowhead <- bowhead %>%
bowheadmap84 <- bowhead_qz %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("Lon","Lat"), crs = 4326) %>%
  st_cast()
```

Change the projection to something appropriate for the Arctic region (still using WGS84)
Check which projection to use on the website <https://epsg.io/?q=>

```{r reproject}
# bowhead <- bowhead %>%
bowheadmap_arct <- bowheadmap84 %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3995)
```

## Maps
Make a map with an arrow indicating the North in the top left corner and a scale in the bottom right corner.
Add a land mask using the command _data(world)_ from package $\texttt{spData}$.
Make sure that you are only showing the region with bowhead whale positions.
(hint: find the bounding box of the data and use _coord_sf_)

```{r map1}
#library(spData)
world <- st_read(system.file("shapes/world.gpkg", package="spData"))
bowheadmap84 %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = world, aes()) +
  geom_sf(data = bowheadmap84, aes()) +
  coord_sf( xlim = c(-22.62913, 75.26850), ylim= c(71.51120, 83.55177)) +
  annotation_scale(location = "bl", width_hint = 0.25) +
  annotation_north_arrow(location = "tr",
                         which_north = "true",
                         pad_x = unit(0.2, "cm"),
                         pad_y = unit(0.1, "cm"),
                         style = north_arrow_fancy_orienteering
                       ) +
  theme_bw() 

```

#rajouter un fond de carte

Make a map with a color code to show individuals. Use a discrete _viridis_ palette.

```{r map2}


#st_bbox(bowheadmap84$geometry)

#library(viridis)
#library(spData)

world <- st_read(system.file("shapes/world.gpkg", package="spData"))
bowheadmap84 %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = world, aes()) +
  geom_sf(data = bowheadmap84, aes(colour = factor(Ind))) +
  coord_sf( xlim = c(-22.62913, 75.26850), ylim= c(71.51120, 83.55177)) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  annotation_scale(location = "br", width_hint = 0.25) +
  annotation_north_arrow(location = "tl",
                         which_north = "true",
                         pad_x = unit(0.2, "cm"),
                         pad_y = unit(0.1, "cm"),
                         style = north_arrow_fancy_orienteering
                       ) +
  theme_bw()

```
  

Map each year in the tracking data with a color code.
Put the color legend at the top of the figure. Use a discrete _viridis_ palette.

```{r map3}
# bowhead %>%
bowheadmap84 %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = world, aes()) +
  geom_sf(data = bowheadmap84, aes(colour = factor(year))) +
  coord_sf( xlim = c(-22.62913, 75.26850), ylim= c(71.51120, 83.55177)) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  annotation_scale(location = "br", width_hint = 0.25) +
  annotation_north_arrow(location = "tl",
                         which_north = "true",
                         pad_x = unit(0.2, "cm"),
                         pad_y = unit(0.1, "cm"),
                         style = north_arrow_fancy_orienteering
                       ) +
  theme_bw()
```

Map each month in the tracking data with a color code (make sure month are ordered from January to December in the legend). 
Put the color legend at the top of the figure and use a discrete _viridis_ palette.

```{r map4}
# mettre Ã§a en tidyverse
bowheadmap84$month <- as.factor(bowheadmap84$month)
levels(bowheadmap84$month) <- c("January", "February", "March", "April", "Mai", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December")


bowheadmap84 %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = world, aes()) +
  geom_sf(data = bowheadmap84, aes(colour = factor(month)))+
  coord_sf( xlim = c(-22.62913, 75.26850), ylim= c(71.51120, 83.55177)) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  annotation_scale(location = "bl", width_hint = 0.25) +
  annotation_north_arrow(location = "tr",
                         which_north = "true",
                         pad_x = unit(0.2, "cm"),
                         pad_y = unit(0.1, "cm"),
                         style = north_arrow_fancy_orienteering) +
  
  theme_bw()

```

## Seasonal space use
Are the individual bowhead whales spending the summer months (June to August) in a different area than during winter months (Dec to Feb)?

Make a map with two panels to answer this question: one panel for summer and one panel for winter.


```{r map5}
# bowhead %>%
bowheadmapseason <- levels(bowheadmap84$month) <- c("Winter", "Winter", "Spring", "Spring", "Spring", "Summer", "Summer", "Summer", "Fall", "Fall", "Fall", "Winter")
bowheadmap84 %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = world, aes()) +
  geom_sf(data = bowheadmap84, aes(colour = factor(month)))+
  coord_sf( xlim = c(-22.62913, 75.26850), ylim= c(71.51120, 83.55177)) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  annotation_scale(location = "bl", width_hint = 0.25) +
  annotation_north_arrow(location = "tr",
                         which_north = "true",
                         pad_x = unit(0.2, "cm"),
                         pad_y = unit(0.1, "cm"),
                         style = north_arrow_fancy_orienteering) +
  
  theme_bw()
```
